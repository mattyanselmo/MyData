We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash. Since taking ownership of the Cold Stone, same-store sales have increased 14%--one of the highest increases of all 1,400 stores nationwide.","small_business","More capital to buy existing business","981xx",6.41,0,"1/1/02",2,NA,NA,9,0,1932,11.4,14,FALSE,NA,5880,1

During college I created my debt and have had the same steady job since graduating. I'm hoping to finally eliminate my debt once and for all.

I'm more than happy to answer any questions about me or my intended use for this loan.<br/> Borrower added on 02/26/10 > I've read through some other available loans and noticed some common<br/>questions that lenders ask. To be proactive I've put together some details<br/>providing my answers to those questions.<br/><br/>I. Background Information<br/><br/>I graduated from college in 12-2006<br/>with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics/Computers. I have also taken<br/>actuarial exams in order to be further my career as an actuary. During<br/>college I ended up getting married and having a son. Going to school<br/>fulltime, and taking care of my family resulted in my accumulation of credit<br/>card debt. While my debt was building the interest rates were in the mid<br/>single digit range, so I wasn't careful enough with the use of the credit<br/>cards. Even as late as last February my rates were so low that instead of<br/>paying off my debt, I used the money I had saved for a down payment on my<br/>house. I've also used savings to pay off student loans instead of my credit<br/>cards. Now that my credit card companies have severely increased my rates,<br/>the balance grows more and more each month. I've never missed or been late<br/>with payments on any bills. I have a lot of recent inquiries on my credit<br/>report because I have recently purchased a used car and compared quotes from<br/>many different companies. Also, for the past month I have been actively<br/>searching for ways to consolidate my credit card debt.<br/><br/>II. Employment Information<br/><br/>I work for Producers Incorporated located in Central Florida. I'm an actuarial<br/>analyst and help manage the sales, administration, and customer service<br/>departments for the company. The company has 35-40 employees and I work<br/>directly with the owner overseeing all areas of the business. The company<br/>sells various insurances and investments. I have been working there since<br/>01-2007 when I graduated from college. <br/><br/>III. Monthly Expenses<br/><br/>Mortgage- $1,412<br/>Auto Loan- $321<br/>Car Insurance- $120<br/>Electric- $150<br/>Water- $90<br/>Cell Phone- $100<br/>Tv- $75<br/>Internet- $25<br/>Minimum Payments on Cards Not Consolidating- $410<br/>Minimum Payments on Card I Want to Consolidate- $433<br/>Current Total- $3,136<br/>After Consolidating total- $3,278 (Replacing the minimum payments on cards I<br/>consolidate with the monthly loan payment)<br/><br/>IV. Loan Goal<br/><br/>My goal with this loan is to pay off the 3 credit cards with the highest<br/>interest rates. I'm hoping to pay off the cards so I can<br/>start cancelling them and reign in my revolving credit lines. By<br/>consolidating my debt with this loan, I'll be able to pay off close to<br/>$16,000 in debt over 3 years, by only increasing my monthly payment by $142.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time and consideration, I'll do whatever I can to promptly<br/>answer any questions you may have.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Derek's Debt Consolidation","327xx",19.52,0,"8/1/03",0,NA,NA,11,0,30966,97.7,18,FALSE,NA,7876,0

The owners of the business will be Bradley and Esther Appleman. Esther M Appleman is currently a certified personal trainer. Bradley is currently studying to receive his Bachelors in business management. The business will consist of 24 hour access to a gym. The gym will currently consist solely on the use of the gym and will offer Yoga and Pilates in the near future. Esther is registered to become a certified Yoga instructor mid-2009. According to City-Data.com (2009) the population of Belfair is over 6 thousand residents. Grapeview/Allyn also has a population of more than 2 thousand residents. The location, which is along highway 3 across from the Safeway store and next to the Kitsap bank, is the main thoroughfare to Bremerton for north-Mason Residents. The current facility has 72 individuals on a monthly payment plan to use the services. The only facility in the area is the one in place and has not allowed new members in several months. We will use advertising on the building, which is highly visible from the main thoroughfare of highway 3. The organization will also be referred clients from the sole local Physical therapy in Belfair, Belfair Physical therapy. Once the completion of the physical therapy is complete, Belfair Physical Therapy will recommend a membership at the establishment. We will also receive referrals from Abel Wellness, which is also located in the building to be used. 	The monthly price will be approximately $30 a month for the gym and $50 a month for access to the yoga and Pilates along with the gym. The current expected fixed cost is $5100 a month and will need approximately 170 members to break even. There are currently 72 members, therefore, only 100 more are needed to break even. 	Our Plan is for either Esther or Bradley to occupy the business during business hours and use an access control system for the after business hours. We will be purchasing much of the equipment from the current establishment. The additional equipment will depend on the number of members and will be increased as needed.","small_business","Form Fit 24 Hour Fitness Center","985xx",16.87,0,"7/1/95",4,NA,NA,19,0,4304,4.1,23,FALSE,NA,8515,0

I am working with a broker and found a really nice diner in a very nice area. It is a well established restaurant earning $6,000/week for breakfast and lunch with the potential for monetary growth. Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement. The restaurant cans seats 65 in the dining room.   About me:  I graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York (www.hws.edu) with a major in Economics and a minor in International Relations.  My educational background, personal experience and career interests has equipped me with the tools to run this business. It has always been my dream to own and run a business and this is a great starter place. I am confident that I can successfully bring this business to the next level. I am currently working as Legal Assistant at a large Financial Company. I am quite accomplished in dealing with a diverse group of individuals from a wide array of backgrounds.  My current salary can cover the loan in case the restaurant does not produce what I am projecting.","small_business","Buy a small diner/Restaurant","104xx",16.58,0,"10/1/00",1,45,NA,6,0,757,22.9,11,FALSE,NA,5329,0

I have a research program that is actively funded by the National Institutes of Health.  What is important about these two points is that I have job stability and a steady, strong source of income.  I am never late on bills, which include student loans, a mortgage, car payment, and credit cards and personal loans.  I am looking to actively pay down debt over the next several years, starting with two accounts.  One is a credit card through Chase that was through Washington Mutual.  When the card transferred to Chase, the interest rate climbed from 10% to 29.99%.  Again, while I have never been late on a payment and continue to make the monthly minimum, I will be unable to pay down the debt (which now stands at just under $3,000) as quickly as I would like and desire a lower rate, something they cannot give to me for 12 months.   Also, a promotional purchase (centrail air installation and furnace work) on a Home Depot card is about to expire, and with it about a $1,000 of interest will be added to the principal amount (now just under $4000) of the loan.  This, combined with the high interest rate (26.99%, which also increased earlier this summer), will make it difficult for me to pay down the debt.  These two accounts are the two primary roadblocks to my plan to decrease my non-mortgage and student loan-related debts.    While my salary provides me with a reasonable debt-to-income ratio, it might sound strange that I underestimated the financial impact of my son following his birth in March of last year.  He began daycare last November, and the $200 weekly daycare payment has made disposable income at a premium, and my desire to make well more than the monthly minimums difficult.    I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and look forward to hearing from you.","debt_consolidation","Bailey - credit card consolidation","541xx",18.82,0,"8/1/94",3,NA,NA,11,0,16120,96.5,27,FALSE,NA,3638,0

A place thriving of independent film makers, production companies, and film studios.  I currently am employed at a job that I have been at for 3 years now.   I am still in the development stages of my business, I have invested 10K of my money from my current job to help build the business (i.e. permit, registrations, equipment, storage)  This is a new business venture for me that I am seeking,  I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on equipment rental's to draw in customers, and also I have 3 years experience as an Independent film maker as well so I know exactly what products are in high demand, and what products are not.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am very familiar with what equipment customers are in high demand of, and 2, I can produce the lowest rates on rentals to attract new customers to my business.  At my current job, I work evenings, so I plan to work both until my business takes off and shows signs of stability (i.e. 12 months of generating profitable income)  With a 10K loan, I will be able to purchase the sufficient ammount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.  The projected annual gross income of this business with the 10K loan is estimated at $21,350, which is based on my current inventory list, and price per item, per month (documentation for this estimate can be provided if requested.)  For the first 1-2 years, my plan is to take all gross profits and 1st, repay any loan(s), and 2nd to invest back into my business to further expand my inventory and reach my goal of doubling my income from year one, and tripling my income for year 3 of business.  With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas. If for some reason, this business venture does not work out.  The loan can easily be repayed from my current primary job that I have been at for the last 3 years, as I do not plan on quitting that job, until either/or, the loan is repayed, or after a year, the business is still generating a profitable return, and showing signs of stability.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your inquiry in my business venture.<br/>Kelly.<br/> Borrower added on 05/25/10 > With this loan I am requesting, I will be able to purchase the sufficient amount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.

However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.

Prior to turning 17 I worked part time from the age of 13.  I held my first real job at a Market Research firm for 10 years.  I worked my way up from telemarketer to Marketing Director eventually landing in Honolulu HI running a branch office.  When that office closed, I went to work for Nextel Communications and was a Customer Relations Manager for about 2 years before moving to CA.  Since living in CA I have had 2 jobs, the first as Operations Manager for an IT Outsourcing company (2 years) and most recently as a Data Analyst with a Telecom Expense Management firm where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years.  There are no gaps in my employment history and I have never been without a job.   I currently have 8 debtors, which includes 7 credit cards at decent interest rates and a small line of credit for overdraft protection.  I have paid off a home mortgage, and 6-8 auto loans with no late payments or fees.  I have never bounced a check, missed a payment, or had any liens against me.  The only issue with my credit report is the credit cards for which I am seeking this loan to pay off, all of which are up to date and in good standing.  My take home pay is about $3K a month.  I have monthly expenses of about $1815($800 rent, $200 car payment, $65 insurance, $150 utilities, currently paying $600+ on credit cards).  My goal is to pay off my credit cards and close all but one of them with this loan.  The remaining credit card I plan on making $150 payments on until paid off.  I would like to purchase another home in 4-5 years once this debt is paid up.  I do have access to family funds and a second income from my partner in the event of any emergencies.  I also have $6K in savings to fall back on.  I am very proud of my credit and payment history and would never do anything to damage my credit.  The majority of this credit card debt was accrued 10+ years ago and I am currently living well within my means.  My problem is that since I have such a large amount of credit card debt banks will not issue me a consolidation loan despite my flawless payment history.  If you invest in me I will not let you down.  If you have any additional questions or concerns please ask away.

I have immaculate credit and I didn't want to let my credit cards amounts get out of hand. They advertised i could get a loan as low as 4.99% but when I called they refused my application because I had not established enough credit history with their business. It blew my mind since I had been discover card member since 2003 or so and had made every payment on time. I begged them to loan me the money because I knew it would help me tremendously with repaying my high intrest rate credit card debt I had accumulated through college and before landing my job after graduation. They finally agreed to finance the loan for $10,000 at 14.99%! Just below my lowest credit card APR at the time. It was disapointing to me because I have such a good credit score. Either way I have paid a little more than the min every month on time, but I can't stand the fact my intrest rate is so high and I have 6 more years of this!  I took up a second job over the summer and have some cash stashed to pay a chunk of but I still can't stand the fact my intrest is so high. I am coming to lendingclub to take out a loan on the remaining principle in hopes of a lower intrest rate and closer pay off date.

My responsibilities continue to grow as I bring in new accounts and expand our offerings. My fiance secured a job in management at a sporting goods store with a national retail company in February, and is eager to make a name for himself here. We are both hardworkers and come from similar backgrounds that stress that. <br/><br/>I bought my condo 3 1/2 years ago - and the housing market as taken a hit. We plan to live here for at least two to three more years to be able to be in a better position with the mortgage. Due to the market drop, a home equity loan is not an option.<br/><br/>We feel we are a good borrower because we have recognized the mistakes we made, and are not happy that we put ourselves in this position. We have been trying for the past few months to get a handle on our debt, but feel we can best do this with a personal loan that can help us better manage our payments, and eventually put us in a position to start saving. Not that we were not before, but are now moreso very careful with our money.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to help us pay off a good number of our credit cards, as well as pay the remaining balance due on our wedding. If we knew now what we knew last summer, maybe we would have approached our wedding differently. But hindsight is 20-20, so now we are just trying to get our finances on the right track. <br/><br/>We know that the monthly payment we take on, if our loan is fully funded, will represent 12% of our monthly income -- and this would help put us in a much better position that we stand right now.<br/> Borrower added on 07/29/10 > We appreciate the investments to date. Lending Club will receive the documents for my employment verification in a few hours --  I was unable to send on Wednesday due to being out of town. <br/><br/>Also, my fiance's gross monthly income is an additional $6,000. <br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>","debt_consolidation","Wedding fund and Credit Card Consolidate","208xx",7.27,0,"1/1/95",0,NA,NA,11,0,12810,86,23,FALSE,NA,9368,0

This loan is being used to pay for my son's wedding and wedding gift---he recently completed an 18-month tour in Iraq, and we couldn't be more elated and relieved that he is finally back home, safe. It will not be the most elaborate wedding, as we are staying budget conscious, but it will hopefully be a beautiful little event that they will always remember.<br/><br/>I was turned on to LC after being directed here by LendingTree. I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.<br/><br/>I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years. I am very fiscally responsible, as you can see by the &quot;A3&quot; loan grade, and I have been working in the financial sector for over 25 years. I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and best regards!<br/>","other","Our little wedding!","331xx",2.58,0,"2/1/83",0,NA,NA,13,0,3270,2.4,37,FALSE,NA,5832,0

On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.<br/><br/>I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.

And this loan will be an important key in the success of my life changing goals.  I plan to use these funds to pay down credit card debt, student loan debt and I am also thinking about using a small portion for something very personal that will change my life forever.  I know I am going to be a great borrower due to the fact that, as I have stated, I take great pride in my financial well-being.  Also, I work for a bank in a department that deals with helping homeowners.  This experience has without a doubt opened my eyes to what can happen when money and budgets are not managed correctly and/or logically, therefore I know what it truly means to be a good borrower to any financial institution that lends money.  My Monthly budget is a simple one, most of my debt is from a couple of credit cards, 1 installment loan, student loans and my rent, which is not a lot because I have 2 roommates and that helps to keep the living expenses down considerably.  I have a car that is completely paid off and is in great condition.  I would be more than happy to answer any questions regarding my monthly budget if more detail is required.  As I have stated I am employed at a Bank, and I feel that after 7 years of working at the bank, I know I have a very stable job.  I was just recently promoted to a much more important role, and this promotion is more proof of how stable my job is and also demonstrates a little more of how I will be a good borrower.

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, IČve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The one man_ shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, all you can eat_ support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. ItČs also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a companyČs IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etc_) A typical computer_ company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business IČve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. ItČs a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.  I appreciate your time and please feel free to contact me for questions.  Thanks for your consideration.","debt_consolidation","Business CC debt Just need a little help","919xx",9.87,0,"1/1/96",0,NA,NA,9,0,54855,10.8,23,FALSE,NA,4198,0

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>","other","Carlos Loan","760xx",12.37,0,"4/1/07",0,NA,NA,10,0,6547,57.4,12,FALSE,NA,3329,0

All but one of them now have an APR of more than 21%!

I want to control my finances and pay cash for things. I will close all of these credit cards except for one. I will not carry a balnce on this card. I will use it with merchants/servicers who only accept credit cards and this will also help me maintain a mix of different types of credit for my FICO score.<br/><br/>I currently allocate $454.00 per month in my budget towards debt repayment. If I were to get this loan, the repayment would be $359.00. I would have almost a $100.00 surplus every month from just the debt repayment allocation in my budget. This money will help me save toward my emergency fund. And with the lower interest rate on this loan, I can get out of debt sooner.<br/><br/>My job is pretty stable and we're growing.

I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.

I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Axing the APR","941xx",16.8,0,"12/1/90",0,NA,NA,9,0,49692,89.3,22,FALSE,NA,8471,0

Purpose of Loan:  I have a couple of personal loans with high interest rates and two credit cards that I would like to consolidate so I can have the ease of paying just one bill.  While we are able to meet all of our financial obligations, we are carrying two mortgages as we had to relocate for my husband's job and sale of our former residence is taking longer than hopped.  As such, we are looking to consolidate some home improvement loans that we'd taken out and credit cards with 0% introductory rates before the introductory periods come to an end.    My financial situation:  We both currently have a good jobs and are able to comfortably make the monthly loan payments.  We am a very hard working individuals and always pay our debts.  My goal is to pay off this loan in less than 1 year so that I may get rid of my debt completely, and start saving money.  I am highly motivated to pay down my debts so that we can focus on our long term savings and investment goals.  Furthermore, I do not have, nor have I ever had, any bankruptcies, unpaid liens or judgments against me.  Should you have any questions about this loan request, please don't hesitate to contact me.  Monthly net income: $ 8,000.00   Monthly expenses: $   Mortgage 1: $ 1022.00   Mortgage 2: $   641.00   Insurance: $ 345.25    Property Taxes: $500   Car expenses: $ 0   Utilities: $ 397.00   Phone, cable, internet: $ 176.00   Food, household, entertainment: $ 800.00   Clothing, household expenses $ 200.00    Credit cards and other loans: $ 482.00*   Student Loans                      $ 107.00   Tithe: $800   Other expenses: $ 0.00   *These are the combined minimum payments for the loans/credit cards we are consolidating.  We've been paying away as much as we are able on our debts.  This loan will eliminate this payment.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.","debt_consolidation","Debit Consolidation","535xx",14.5,0,"1/1/00",3,NA,NA,12,0,17717,67.4,26,FALSE,NA,7396,0

I accumulated the debt over the last 3 years because of my own ignorance, by using credit cards as emergency fund. Three months ago I discovered the Dave Ramsey plan and have been an avid follower ever since. Right now I have a 6k in savings for emergencies. In the last three months I paid off my car and the smallest credit card. I've got 5 cards total and would like to consolidate two of the largest ones into one loan and knock out the other three individually. I forecast to be finished with paying all of my debt(besides the condo) in two years. I'm a truck driver(owner-operator) with my own paid for truck, so even these tough times don't make me hurt as much as some of my peers that have huge truck payments. My finances are listed below:  5679 - monthly income -1194 - condo pmts -740 - groceries -280 - gas for car -190 - utilities(elect, Heat, Tel) -800 - entertainment, house-hold goods, etc =2475 left for savings.  I've never known that I have so much money left over until I did my first budget.

This is a badly needed move for us, as my husband has been unemployed for over two years now, ever since the company he was working for closed all offices and moved out of state.  After such a extended period of unemployment, and despite several major cuts in our living expenses, the savings we had two years ago have been exhausted, and although this move would mean a much more secure financial home for us and our two young children, we don't have the capital to pay for our move.<br/><br/>If this posting looks familiar, it is because it already has been posted.  There was a mistake on my credit repot that caused the credit department to remove the loan.  After discovering the error, I fixed it and we are now trying this process again.  The original request was for $7500, but since that posting, we have had money come in from an unexpected source, so we are able to drop the amount of the loan.<br/><br/>We now have the rental truck paid for along with our estimated costs for hotel, food, and gas.  What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!  I have never defaulted on a financial obligation in my life, even when I had to make sacrifices to fulfill my responsibilities, and you will get every penny of your money back, plus your interest.  With the new position, and the decreased rent (due to geographic factors as well as scaling down from a 3BR apartment to a 2BR apartment) we will be paying, we will have an increase in our available cash flow each month more than 5 times our loan payment.<br/>","moving","Moving for a New Job","925xx",21.91,0,"10/1/98",0,75,NA,6,0,20390,97.1,16,FALSE,NA,805,0

Over the past year, with the assistance of the VA Vocational Rehabilitation program, I have invested over $100,000 in Operation: ROCK the HOUSE which is outlined below.  I did something similar while I was in the service in Germany.  Op: ROCK the HOUSE has a pretty tight timeline that doesnČt allow for intermittent delays (troops are returning everyday) like I have encountered in applying for a Patriot Express Loan. I am asking for $1,400 that will be used as working capital and operational expenses to continue the project until either my Patriot Express Loan or one of the other repayment scenarios comes through. 	 By investing so much, I ran up my credit cards to the point that my RLU has taken a toll on my standard 720 credit score.  Thus, a portion of this loan will be used to pay down the credit cards and improve my RLU.  Once I receive the Patriot Express Loan this loan will then be repaid in full. 	 The next several repayment scenarios involve the VA.  One, the VA VocRehab program reimburses me for the majority of my investment and this loan is paid off; two, the VA gets around to processing a VA disability claim I have in the neighborhood of $30,000 and this loan is paid off; or, three, and coincidentally the day my wife looks forward to the most, the VA finally processes another claim I have that amounts to roughly $75,000 in back-benefits and this loan is paid off.    Lastly, a large department store chain has asked to receive samples of our product line.  A portion of this loan will go toward having the samples manufactured.  The revenues from sells of the products will allow the loan to be serviced if not repaid entirely.  Of all the scenarios, this one is my favorite. 	 Thank you for your interest and hopefully your support.  Regardless, we look forward to seeing you during Op: ROCK the HOUSE.  Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is a Homecoming Celebration_ for service members by a service member. It lasts all summer long and is performed in three major acts. 	Act 1: May 5, 2009Drop date. The release of a unique compilation CD, that has notable artists performing songs written by disabled Army veteran, Jet West.   	OBJECTIVE: A theme song and celebration soundtrack_ to provide a means of national identity, espirit de corps, and party music for a nation-wide celebration in honor of returning American troops.  	Act 2: May 23-25, Memorial Day WeekendShort Shots Leg 2, Short Shots, occurs as people across America shoot short video clips for the homecoming music video.  	OBJECTIVE: Embody the spirit of rebirth in the nation as it brings about new hope with new promise for all generations and celebrate the American military members who keep it possible.  	Act 3: September 4-7, Labor Day WeekendTrooptastic Finale Three days of concerts held simultaneously in three cities with performers rotating between cities.   	Active military and veterans admitted free with government-issued picture IDavailable free through the VA. Ticket prices set in inverse proportion to corporate sponsorship. Seeded with sales of the CD. 	OBJECTIVE: A national event to honor and celebrate the work of the military men and women who keep us free. 	Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is the brain child of disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year, Jet West. Jet West Music Group Ltd is getting its start through the VA VocRehab program with financing made possible by LendingClub.com, the SBA Patriot Express Loan Initiative for veterans and, of course,  the thousands of contributors to Operation: ROCK the HOUSE. Jet West Music Group intends to use proceeds from these events to expand the entertainment options of service members stationed around the world far into the future starting with shows for the service members who missed Operation: ROCK the HOUSE.","small_business","Operation: ROCK the HOUSE","891xx",5.07,0,"2/1/03",2,NA,NA,3,0,0,NA,6,FALSE,NA,158,0

One of the cards has an approximate balance of $9500.  I closed that account, which may have hurt my credit, but I will never have anything to do with Chase or any business affiliated with them.  At least not knowingly.  In four months time, from the time they took over the account from Washington Mutual, they raised my percentage rate twice, forced me to make two payments in one month, charged me a late fee and then reduced my credit limit, which was the final straw for me. The remaining amount of the loan will be placed into my savings account as part of my emergency fund. My significant other of 11 years lost his job a year ago in a reorganization.  He was fortunate to find another job, but for less pay.  Due to the economy, there is less work and the company has cut back on hours.  Since April of this year, his paychecks cover only child support.  I believe in keeping a savings account to cover at least 3-6 months of household expenses or as an emergency fund, which I have had to tap into during the past year. Paying the monthly bills is not a problem but adding to savings has not been easy. This loan will permit me to continue to pay the bills and add to the savings.

They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well. <br/><br/>I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).<br/><br/>With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment.

This is a skill I want to master to create wealth.  I'm also enjoying the experience as I don't need the money.  I don't have a mortgage, my income exceeds my expenses and I'm very meticulous about spending.  I have good control over myself mentally, spiritually and emotionally, therefore I have good control over my money. My only debt is a car lease and a interest free care credit loan for my lasik (i could have paid cash but why not get interest free financing).  My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?  Again, this is for the experience, I can comfortably afford the loan and interest, but I think this experience will make me better in business.  There is bad debt, when you buy liabilities or things that depreciate.  This is good debt, the kind that puts money in my pocket building an asset.

With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.

I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA. However, not many banks are willing to lend to a business where the main source of revenue is the sale of tobacco, even more a startup.  We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.

I currently have three credit cards ($8400, 4200, and $600 balances). I would like to consolidate these debts into one payment for convenience as well as to maximize APR once promotional rate expires on these accounts.  My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!). I currently work as a paralegal and make $36,000 per year before OT, but also cater for added income, and I am very simple with my spending. I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.  My monthly budget: Salary: $2700.00 per month Mortgage/rent: $280.00 (I live with friends so rent is very cheap) Insurance: $56.00 Car expenses: $89.00 (use public transportation in Boston at $89.00 per month for train pass) Utilities: $100.00 (not part of rental agreement. Rent is one flat fee) Food, entertainment: $160.00 Clothing, household expenses $100.00 Credit cards and other loan payments: $465.00 (3 credit cards 3.99%, 12.99% and 0%) Other expenses: $39.99  Overall, I feel I am great investment, with a simple request.

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance. Now many of the promotional APR offers have expired on those cards and the rates have gone way up.     1. Bank of America American Express - $8,272 @ 10%    2. Chase Visa - $2,550 @ 19%    3.

At the same time it will build more equity and make the house look better as well. <br/><br/>We are going to replace some drafty windows and will better insulate our attic to help in the summer and winter months. We are considering adding another layer of roofing or replacing it all together as well.<br/><br/>I am a responsible person and my credit rating shows that. Please be assured that my debt obligations are always met. I have a stable job and so does my wife.<br/><br/>Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. Thanks!<br/> Borrower added on 03/30/10 > I thought I would be able to edit answers but I can't so I'm adding to an answer in this section. opp2grow asked what my wife does and Senior Account showed up when I wanted to put Senior Accountant. He/she also asked what my delinquency was 72 months ago. It was a credit card that was paid late since I lived in a three family house and when one of the families moved they did a change of address for the family (not individually) and I so happen to have the same last name. All my mail went to another State! Obviously this was before I paid my bills online and did it the receive a statement send a check way.<br/>","home_improvement","Home Improvement to make Home Green (Energy Efficient)","117xx",18.59,0,"10/1/98",0,72,NA,7,0,5571,42.2,20,FALSE,NA,5109,0

The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.  After that, I hope to become an investing member of LendingClub.  If you have any questions or would like further details, please ask!  Thank you for having faith in me.<br/> Borrower added on 05/04/10 > In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.<br/><br/>LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT<br/>Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years <br/>Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years<br/>GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years<br/>MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years<br/><br/>The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  <br/><br/>The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a no-brainer for me.  <br/><br/>One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 05/05/10 > Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous!<br/> Borrower added on 05/07/10 > I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.

So I am turning to get some help. <br/>I'm also using the loan to consolidate the remaining amount of my credit cards, which stands at $3700 dollars.  The remaining amount will be added to my account to help pay for my rent and other essential costs.  I want to mention that I am an extremely hardworking guy who constantly monitors his credit score.  I currently hold an average score of 750. I always pay my bills, pay more than the minimum, and keep an eye on what I spend.<br/> Borrower added on 04/26/10 > Living on my own has been a goal of mine for some time now.

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are above and beyond the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such above and beyond circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment.

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

I hope others that use this site have an equal level of respect for those that have chosen to funnel their own earnings into someone's loan request.

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.

So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etc˘ÎÎ_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, ˘ÎÎStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa˘ÎÎ_, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>","small_business","Urban Transportation","750xx",8.04,0,"11/1/05",1,NA,NA,7,0,14729,85.6,8,FALSE,NA,9454,1

This is new to me.  I am a straight forward person and would like to explain my loan request.  I am looking to consolidate lines of credit, credit cards, etc...  My mother is ill and is on a transplant list. I  have taken out some loans to help my mother and ease some of her financial burden. Along with my own debt, it has been a bit overwhelming, but I  I have an excellent job, lots of motivation and determination.  I have ways to pay off debt, where she does not.  The 16000.00 would be used for this and only this.  I am not wanting anything other than just to manage things a bit easier and relieve some of the daily stress that I have.  I am a trustworthy person and would like someone to take a chance on me.  I know that my credit is not perfect, but my scores have been getting higher and I have been working hard for the past few years to make a difference on my credit report.  I have a request like many others, I am sure. My credit may come across to some as a high risk, but I can assure you that I am not.  I take my debts seriously and take responsibility for them. I have helped more than I should at times, but that is who I am.  I am confident in myself and want you to be as well.  Thank you for your consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 05/01/10 > This loan is very secure for the lender.  I have a very stable job and take pride in my work ethics.  I am simply trying to pay down my debt, increase my credit score, and manage my debts as simple as possible.  I am not a risk and have worked hard over the ast few years to really understand how to increase your credit and be considered a good candidate when applying for loans.  I would be thankful to the person or persons who fund my loan.  I am hoping to close this as soon as possible.  I want to change my current situation.  I would like one line vs. 6 or more.  I am making a difference not only for me but my faimly.  I would also be interested in doing future business with a lender that is willing to take a chance on me now.  I am true to my word and have many goals past the one I am trying to accomplish right now.  Again, thank you for your consideration. This is a whole new way to work with others to help each other- where both parties benefit.  I am hopeful that I will be a customer for many years to come.  Maybe someday for something a bit more exciting, but I am on my way!<br/> Borrower added on 05/02/10 > Here are the details of the debts I am looking to consolidate.  If I am fully funded I am going to get as many lines paid down as I can.  I usually pay more than the minimum and I would continue to do this on this one loan as well.   That would offset some of the higher interest being paid on some.  My overall payment would be lower and I would increase my credit score with the fewer number of lines and revolving credit.  I am not looking to continue to keep more than one cc. when pd off. I will close and pay off.  I believe I should let them report paid with a o balance and then start closing them.

I prepare a report every day and make recommendations to the company rep. on location. I basically spend 1/2 a year on a drilling rig, the other half at home or doing whatever I want.

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

I generally post my payments one to two weeks before the due date.  I made the mistake 3 years ago to do a cash transfer, thinking it transferred with the same interest rate of fixed interest rate of 9.9 %, and to my horror the interest was over 21%. My step-son was moving to our area to live with us, and I needed to come up with rent and deposit quickly since we lived in a small place at the time. I transferred $3000.00. I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing. I think you will find that I have excellent credit and hope to find a more reasonable rate for my debt. We very rarely use our credit card and only used it recently for a car repair of $1000.00 I applied for a different card recently to see if it would cover the cost, but am reluctant to use it and it doesn't cover enough to take care of the higher interest portion.

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.  I have developed working relationships with Hilton, Marriott, and various other resort companies here in South Florida, and I plan to begin an online reservation system and Franchise plan in the near future.  This extra capital will allow me to stretch a vital purchase out over time in order to not hinder further growth and progress of my small business.","small_business","Replace blown outboard engine","334xx",14.16,0,"2/1/92",0,NA,NA,10,0,41893,62.5,23,FALSE,NA,6725,0

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in context for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollarČs ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read_ well I wonČt digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!","debt_consolidation","Consolidate Debt / Arbitrage","921xx",2.65,0,"7/1/96",0,NA,NA,4,0,6512,16.4,4,FALSE,NA,5106,0

The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal you give me money, I say thanks and make payments kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctorČs bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and IČve never missed a payment on anything.","educational","Adopt a math student!","294xx",29.6,0,"9/1/03",1,0,0,6,0,3043,58.5,6,FALSE,NA,1253,0

I run an Internet marketing company and I am seeking funds to help launch my latest and greatest project, a Chicago community website.  Funds will mostly be used for web development work and initial marketing expenses.  The website will make money from network sponsorships. Due to our already established local connections we already have many paying clients lined up waiting for the website to launch. These payments will be significantly higher then our monthly loan repayment which will allow us to pay the loan off early.  We estimate the loan will be paid off in full in 12-16 months. We consider this a safe loan because even if the business is a complete flop (not likely!) I have an existing income stream from other websites that will more then cover the payments with no hassle. Payments will be automatic and always on time. I am also investing a great deal of my own cash into this project, so I have complete faith in the business.

Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.<br><br>  I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know.

I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.

Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner.

What insurance didn't cover went on high interest medical credit cards. (Conveniently offered at the pre-op visit when emotions are high)  What a difference a day makes, 24 little hours turned my whole world upside down. Dont get me wrong, I am very appreciative for a clean bill of health. However, I feel like I'm being held hostage. No matter how much I double up on the payments the interest just eats the payments up.  This loan would pay off everything and would offer a repayment interest rate that's more than half of what I currently pay now. This is such a great opportunity for me. Since the medical ordeal I returned to school and am now finishing up my Business Degree. Having paid cash for tuition and books, along with my HOPE Scholarship things would look pretty good.    I was delighted to read earlier in the disclosure that there is no pre-payment penalty. I plan to double my payments which would mean financial freedom for me in less than two years. Additional education makes me eligible for a promotion.  A Senior Analyst position would increase my current salary to almost 1/3 more.   This loan would make the difference for me.

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

I have paid off Capital One which has a limit of $450, although I think that's not reflecting on my credit report yet.<br/><br/>I will use approx $6800 to pay off all my credit cards, $6000 I owe to my brother, $8000 for the ring and then another $2000 for home improvement.  Any remaining funds I will leave in an emergency savings account.<br/><br/>I am going through the steps now to veify my bank account and I will talk to Lending Club asap to verify my income.  If you have any questions then please let me know.  I feel very strongly about my obligations and any debts I have.  I wouldn't be considering proposing unless I felt like I have my life going in the right direction.  I just need the extra help right now so I can get there.  Thanks for your time.<br/>","wedding","Help make me the happiest man alive","321xx",12.96,0,"7/1/04",0,NA,NA,7,0,7302,88,12,FALSE,NA,4004,0

I spent the winter restoring the interior and all it needs now is this engine rebuild.   Having the engine overhauled boosts the airplanes value from it's current $20k market value to around $30-$32k and makes it more fuel efficient and reliable.  Once the airplane is flying again, I plan of flying it for various charitable missions, including Angel Flight, Young Eagles and Pilots n Paws (animal rescue). Flying is my passion and I like to apply this passion in a way that I can help others!  I recently relocated back to MA, am college degreed with 20+ years career experience. I recently accepted a new job in the medical device industry, and have a decent income ($90k/year) going forward, but living expenses while out of work, plus necessary move costs incurred to get myself here have depleted my current cash reserves.  Based on my new job income ($7500/mo) , I will be in a position to pay off my current credit cards and service this loan without any difficulty, in fact, if they provided shorter terms, I'd gladly pay off in  just 4 months. but am OK with carrying this loan out to it's 36 month (3 year) term. Longer term, I am looking to eventually buy real estate (condo or starter house)    Time is of the essence! The engine rebuilders in PA already have the airplane engine in their shop now and I need these funds to get the 4 week remanufacturing cycle started. They need $6k down and the balance upon delivery. I will have the funds (through future pay checks) to cover the aircraft mechanics fees to reinstall engine when it's done.

Dixie Hwy, Unit 13D Crete, IL 60417 I started selling a few items from home in 1999 on Ebay and have since expanded to sell on Amazon, a web site and we supply products for Overstock.com.  Sales last Year topped $3,000,000 but admittedly are down app 15% this year. For that reason it is time to Get Serious.  On ebay we are namou (55.000 + feedback) with an ebay store titled Abetterwaytobuy. On Amazon we are Abetterwaytobuy. But when we ship for Overstock it is in the Overstock name. It is safe to say that  if you buy a radar detector, CB Radio or Police scanner from Overstock there is a good chance it is actually coming from us. (we are 1 of several Overstock Partners that supply that type of merchandise for them.   The money will be used for:  1. Increasing Inventory I intend to increase inventory. ( the no. of SKUs) Width of inventory is the key to my business. There is not much risk involved as I can accurately predict what I can sell most anything for, as research is a close as any computer. I simply do not buy anything at a price that  does not allow  me to be among the very lowest price for any given item  online.   2.upgrading  my web site  www.abetterwaytobuy.net.    To date I have not spent any money on  design, on search engine optimization or on marketing said web site. I am confident the plans i have for the site will increase sales markedly.

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>","debt_consolidation","DebtCon","980xx",9.84,1,"2/1/87",0,11,NA,9,0,35061,94.2,30,FALSE,NA,2729,0

About a year ago I  hit a low point in my life and was struggling with everything !!!!!! One of the hardest times for me which gave me the final push I needed to make a change was the fact that I ended a very serious six year relationship.

Well not ANYMORE!!!  I vowed to myself to do what  makes me happy and to live my OWN life!!!   	For me, Education and Exploring are my biggest passions!!!!  About four months ago I received the opportunity to move to MIAMI and attend FIU where I have the prospect  to study abroad in Germany!!!!  I jumped on this opportunity of a lifetime and have been saving all the money I have made  over the past four months but I'm about 2000 short of reaching my goal to pay for tuition!! I have already applied for loans and grants and have  received as much as I could from them. I need more help so that's why I came to the Lending Club! I have used this program before and I˘ÎÎČm currently at great standing with this program. I have never been late on a payment and I'm a trustworthy member.

When one of the scores dropped below 720 the hard to get mtg was declined. I have not even made a late payment on any of my credit cards but I understand they are doing this to everyone now.  So now I want to pay off, or down, the credit cards in order to get the mortgage.  I could also use a hard money lender with the house as collateral, and the lender being the mtg holder, but they ask too high a rate, and my credit is good I shouldn't have to pay loan shark interest!  I am very reliable and trustworthy, and my credit rating is important to me and my hobby (real estate).  I have three homes that I own free and clear that I could have in another day and time, just gotten the equity out of, but banks aren't lending now!  Help me beat the credit card companys at their own game !<br/>","credit_card","Beating them at their own game","320xx",19.36,0,"10/1/93",1,NA,NA,13,0,10461,64.6,55,FALSE,NA,9297,0

Due to the fact it was not required by my company but rather my own personal choice, I will not be getting a stipend to move. I will be getting a pay increase due to the nature of the cost of living.   I am applying for the loan in order to put down first month's rent and security deposit. The application for the apartment will be processed Monday morning and by the end of the week I will need to have that money upfront to secure the apartment.   I also wanted to apply for a personal loan in order to build my credit. I have never taken out a loan in my name and thought taking out a small loan would help to better my credit.   I am financially responsible and have never been late on any of my credit card payments.   In addition I receive an annual monetary gift from my grandfather in January. Therefore I will be able to pay off the loan by then.  I hope you find me a perfect candidate for the loan.","other","Manhattan Apartment Downpayment","130xx",1.71,0,"11/1/03",1,NA,NA,5,0,2697,69.2,11,FALSE,NA,1227,0

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.  We both have good, steady jobs, and would be able to pay back all principle and interest due in 3 years or less.

We both have stable jobs and his expenses are even less than mine. I'm an honest person and I make my payments on time. The reason I had delinquent accounts in the past is because I was in the process of settling credit card debt that I unwisely accrued early on in college.

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve Cornell˘ÎÎČs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wife˘ÎÎČs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We don˘ÎÎČt own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wife˘ÎÎČs is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!  We are working to pay down debt - our mortgage is conventional and we pay towards principal on all other debts each month.  Please contact me if you have any questions, and thank you for considering this request. God Speed!","home_improvement","Basement","801xx",16.28,0,"11/1/90",0,NA,NA,15,0,73257,60,32,FALSE,NA,9388,0

What makes me a good borrower:  I have excellent credit and have never been delinquent on a payment.  I pay my obligations on time.  My income is more than adequate to cover the monthly cost of this loan.  My income & budget:  Our 2010 gross sales were $100,317, with net profits of $38,731.  Our personal household budget is $3000 per month and includes rent, utilities, insurance, groceries, and all other household expenses.  How stable is my income:  We have increased sales and net profits each year since we began in 2006.  We have 2 full time employees to help us, and we are bringing on a third employee in 2 weeks.  We are hiring a part time salesperson also.  Starting June 1st, we will begin a professional business growth coaching program.

I am looking to consolidate it all to improve my credit score to qualify for a business loan.  A good business loan requires a credit score of at least 720.  I am almost there.  I have a steady job and business that can give plenty of positive return.  I expect to pay off the LendingClub loan not in 3 years but in 6 months once I close 1 or 2 deals in my business or get that business loan.  My business involves real estate.  I will be purchasing distressed or bank owned properties and then reselling.  I already have a serious list of cash buyers and conventional financed buyers to resell to.  I have access to hard money lenders that will only lend to purchase property at wholesale price and resell at retail price where the difference is our profit.  If you want more details feel free to contact me.  The loan I am requesting right now is only a debt consolidation loan to improve my credit score and lower payments.  I have had no problem making payments just a problem getting a sufficient loan for my business or debt consolidation from a regular bank.  They are obviously not lending and want higher scores than what I have.  Thanks and hope to do business with you.  <br/><br/>","debt_consolidation","Consolidate my Debt","113xx",16.05,0,"6/1/04",1,NA,NA,10,0,13013,66.1,17,FALSE,NA,4641,1

My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.","small_business","Partnership Bridge Loan","220xx",15.16,0,"5/1/87",0,33,NA,8,0,134025,67.9,16,FALSE,NA,8531,0

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan B was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan C is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan C.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job. I have been with my current employer for only 1 year and 7 months, but have been in the same industry for 12 years, with only one previous employer (in this industry). The current amount we pay to the window credit card is $216 a month, which is easily manageable.

Luckily in CA as a 1st time home buyer I still have an opportunity to apply for the $10,000 tax credit that they extended until the end of this year. My intentions are to use the majority of the tax credit to pay off my loan. I do understand that there is a possibility that for some reason I may not receive the tax credit in full and that is why I mentioned 2-3 years to pay it off. I have a good credit score and good rapport with all of my creditors. I always pay within my terms and more often then not pay my balances off prior to the due dates. For example I just recently paid off my car approx 6 months ahead of schedule.<br/> Borrower added on 08/25/10 > My fiance and I have been pre-approved for a home mortgage loan of up to 325k, but given that this is our 1st home we are shopping in the market of 225k and below which would keep us well under our budget and not be overwhelming. I am the co-borrower on the mortgage loan and my fiance is the primary borrower. Even with this newly aquired debt of the personal loan our income to debt ratio will not be drastically affected. Our current combined annual income exceeds 100k and our debt to income ratio w/o our current rent and with this new loan payment is at approx 16%. Our debt to income ratio with our current rent payment of $950.00 and this new loan payment is approx 24%. The ideal debt to income ratio that mortgage lenders and investors would like to see is at 36% and we are well below that with our combined income and debts. This loan combined with some of our savings would help cover our 3.5% down payment on our 30 Year Fixed FHA loan as well as the closing and moving cost. I hope that this answers all of your questions and helps you instill the confidence in us to contribute to our loan.

My wife and I were married Valentines day this year.  We recently closed on our first home on 8/31/07.  We have four beautiful children.  With the new mortgage (and all the other bills that come with our home), we have found ourselves over our head in debt.  We are in dire need of assistance to maintain the life we have been steadily building for our family. Our income and debt are as follows:  I have been an auto tech for nearly 3 years with the same employer.  This year, I was promoted to manager, which, helped us realize our dream of homeownership.  My wife works part time as a CSR at the same company.   I earn 60k/annually My wife $17k Average Net monthly income: $4500  Our monthly debts:  Mortage $1120.00 Vehichle:$639.00 Credit Card: $100.00 Credit Card: $ 89.00 Short term Personal Loan: $150.00 Short term Personal Loan: $190.00 Car insurance: $125.00 Utilities:  $300.00 Cell Phones: $80.00 Gas: $300.00 Food:$600.00 (with tons of coupons) Daycare: $120/wk  With this loan we intend to pay off the two personal loans.  This will give clear at least $340 a month! This is a big deal to us.  This will be our first step in a series towards reducing our debt.  All of our bills have ALWAYS been paid on time and remain current.  My credit profile is being penalized because I have never had much credit. We are honest, loving, and giving people. We take nothing and no person for granted.  We thank you for any contribution you make. Please feel free to ask us any questions.  Thank you!

I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.

I'm in a very stable position regarding my career as an insurance broker and have recently received a salary increase that will allow me to become debt-free. That being said, I'd much rather deal with this interest rate than my current CC rate (16.99%). If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask. I appreciate your help and look forward to being in your shoes soon. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > Lending Club, <br/>As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full.<br/>&bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? <br/>I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job.  <br/>My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road!<br/>My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. <br/>&bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? <br/>Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99%<br/>Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99%<br/>I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded.  <br/>&bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? <br/>Rent - $600 per month<br/>Car Payment - $206 per month<br/>The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc.<br/>&bull;	Monthly Budget <br/>Gross Income = $5,000 <br/>Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.)<br/>&bull;	My Plan (with your help!)<br/>Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up.  <br/>The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).  With a planned payment of $500 each month, I will have this completely paid off by September 2012 and then be in the position to help someone else out.  Thank you in advance and I look forward to any further questions!<br/>","debt_consolidation","Ready to go from Borrower to Investor!","282xx",5.54,0,"7/1/03",1,26,NA,8,0,0,0,11,FALSE,NA,5502,0

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.
