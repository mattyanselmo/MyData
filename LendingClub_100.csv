I've worked my whole life to look good on a piece of a paper, that's what my mother taught me. I pay all of my bills every month before the due date and nothing is going to change that about me because looking good on a piece of paper is the only thing that matters to lenders now-a-days. When I say look good on a piece of paper I mean credit score, number of debts, etc.   So I told all of you what I would be using the money for and why I would be a good candidate for the loan. Now I want you to understand my complete situation. I am planning to have my wedding in 2010 and with this economy everything seems to get a little tougher over time. I've done all the math with regards to monthly payments for the loans and I have more than enough for that and all of my other bills and responsibilities.

One is to do some major renovation on our home that sorely needs it and two, to knock down a couple more credit cards that have way too high interest on them.<br/>There are several projects to be done but the major one is that we need to replace a deck and while doing so fix some foundational problems.  If we are blessed to obtain full funding we will do a few more things that need getting done.<br/><br/>We have used Lending Club before to borrow and have never missed a payment over the last 2 years.  I did some calculating and found that after paying off the remainder of the first loan with Lending Club and paying off a couple high interest cards that we will actually lower our monthly payments for debt.  Having this loan will drop our payments by a couple hundred dollars per month which is definitely advantageous.<br/><br/>Thanks for investing in our loan request and please feel free to ask any questions you may have.<br/><br/>Thank you...........

Here is some information that may be helpful to you in making your decision.<br/>I will be using this loan to consolidate three credit cards.<br/>I have never missed or made a late payment on these credit cards or on any other debt.<br/>I discovered Lending Club and found that the rates available here are less than what I am paying on my credit cards.<br/>As I indicated above I have never missed a payment, and the monthly payment for this loan is roughly half what I am paying now.  <br/>I will be repaying this loan well in advance of the 5 year term.<br/>My payment history on all debts is flawless.  However, I am told that my credit score has suffered as a result of the following:<br/>&bull;My debt to income ratio is too high.  A couple things you may want to know about this.  <br/>     oMy monthly income is $9200 and I have been with my employer for over 10 years.  My wife&rsquo;s monthly income is $3900.  Combined monthly income is $13,100.  As you can see making this payment is well within our means.<br/>     oThis loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.<br/>     oThere are two homes on my credit report.  One of them is a vacation home that I rent out.<br/>     oWe have a family member that lives with us who also contributes towards paying bills.<br/><br/>&bull;My credit card balances are high in comparison to their credit limits<br/>     oAs you may be aware with the recent bank crisis many banks have started lowering credit limits on existing accounts.  Since my limits have been lowered my balance is now closer to the card limit.<br/>     oBy paying off my credit cards I expect to see my credit score go back up since my total balance will be a smaller percentage of my total available credit.  My point being that I am very interested in improving my credit score so defaulting on this loan is the farthest thing from my mind.<br/><br/>Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions you may have.<br/>Thank you,<br/> Borrower added on 12/19/10 > My original description read &quot;This loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  This should have read &quot;This loan will of course all be used to pay off credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  Sorry for any confusion.<br/><br/>In reviewing the questions Lending Club investors often ask of loan requesters I found the most often is postion within their company.
