The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.  After that, I hope to become an investing member of LendingClub.  If you have any questions or would like further details, please ask!  Thank you for having faith in me.<br/> Borrower added on 05/04/10 > In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.<br/><br/>LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT<br/>Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years <br/>Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years<br/>GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years<br/>MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years<br/><br/>The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  <br/><br/>The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a no-brainer for me.  <br/><br/>One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 05/05/10 > Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous!<br/> Borrower added on 05/07/10 > I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.

A friend of mine just won tickets to the World Cup in South Africa - free tickets to 6 games.  The bad news?  My airline ticket and lodging will come out to around $4,000.  I've just paid off all of my debt and am in good financial position, but do not have the cash on hand today to pay for this whole trip.  I could put this on a credit card, but I really prefer the structure and better interest rates of a personal loan.  I used Lending Club to consolidate some student loan debt and it was a great experience.  I know my lenders would agree.  This trip is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I just can't convince myself to pass.

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

This application, VinyasaMT, allows the user to manage projects and data from anywhere in the world. All you need is access to the Internet. The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base  about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of FordČs approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

It seemed like a great idea to borrow money any time I fell short while in school since I had to pay my own way and I figured that the salary that I would be making after graduation would be more than adequate for quick repayment. I graduated three years ago with my B.S. and have worked hard to improve my financial situation since. I have learned a good deal about investments and credit while trying to pay off my debts and purchasing a home (87% LTV). I actually did manage to pay off and close nine accounts (various credit cards and an auto loan) which amounted to half of my total 'bad' debt, but the remaining five credit accounts are not budging. I am at the point where I have tried long enough to get rid of them that I believe that I need to just wipe them out at once. I have eliminated the physical cards and have been living off of income only. I have never missed a payment on any debt and I have never been late making a payment so I consider myself no risk to lenders. I have a good-excellent borderline credit score. The only tarnish on my credit file is the balance on these five accounts.","debt_consolidation","Sliced Up Credit Cards","326xx",9.78,0,"9/1/99",0,NA,NA,6,0,20732,96,22,FALSE,NA,8388,0

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan B was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan C is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan C.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job. I have been with my current employer for only 1 year and 7 months, but have been in the same industry for 12 years, with only one previous employer (in this industry). The current amount we pay to the window credit card is $216 a month, which is easily manageable.

The loan will also help with the first few monthly payments until we have all 4 patients.  Revenue for this start-up will be split among 2 sources: patient's social security payments and patient's out of pocket payments (sometimes paid for by the patient's family members).  Based on conservative financial projections, it is estimated that positive cash flow will occur starting in month 7 and the overall break-even will occur at about month 15.

We thought this would be a good time to finish the basement while the children are young enough to enjoy the space and encourage them to hang out at home under our watchful eye than elsewhere. The design is simple - a wide open space with walls, ceiling, outlets, lights, carpeting and a bathroom. We pay our bills and have a steady income without any surprises.

I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing.

On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.<br/><br/>I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.

About 5 years ago I was still moving up in the company I work for. My husband was laid off in his job with an adverstising firm. We had a lot of school loans, credit card debt, etc. When we were younger we did not make the best decisions on purchases and spending. Like a lot of young people, we had lots of credit card debt and were in over our heads. We could make payments on the credit cards when we were both working, though we were not making a lot of headway in paying them down. Then when my husband lost his job we took on more debt just to stay afloat. We missed a lot of payments. <br/>Over the last 5 years I have moved up in my job and now make around $90,000 a year. My husband makes between $55,000 and $75,000, depending on the amount of overtime he gets during the year. In the last few years my husband and I have dug ourselves out of over $80,000 in debt. <br/>All we have now is a house payment at $1,100/15 years, his truck payment $360/month 2 1/2 years remaining, and an old personal loan $157/month &ndash; matures 2014 at 8%. <br/>It has just been in this last year that we finally got to this point. Then this happens. I don&rsquo;t have the $12,000+ saved up to fix the small flood in my front yard. (I asked for $14,000 as I will have to have my walk path re-poured and don&rsquo;t know exactly how much that will cost.) I really can&rsquo;t wait another 6-8 months to save the money to get this fixed. I really need to get it fixed in the next few weeks before it gets really bad. <br/>I can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I do not want to take on this loan. I don&rsquo;t want to be back in debt but do not have a choice. We have checked with several banks and they will lend us the money, since we have such great income. But because of all of the past debt we had where we were late on our payments (when my husband had no job and I was only making around $35,000 a year) they want to loan it to us at 23-25%. If that is my only choice I will have to accept it. But, my husband encouraged me to give it a few days and try this site since the interest rate is lower. I am very nervous about getting a loan in this manner but he says &ldquo;have faith&rdquo; and see what this brings.

We are not in trouble yet, but I want to be proactive about tightening up the ship and not spending money where I don't have to. That includes high interest rates on debt.

I'd like to pay these all off and have one payment  I've been with my employer for (3) years as a  buyer.  I'm also a part time student at a local community College. I'm a hard working individual who lives less than 30 minutes from my employer.  I have great credit rating and i'm looking to improve that score my paying off of my debt.","debt_consolidation","Changes","907xx",22.24,0,"6/1/90",1,NA,NA,21,0,3756,27.6,51,FALSE,NA,7726,0

They have been in the house for 1.5 years and have expressed an interest in buying the home, but due to the South Florida Real Estate market, and the huge amount of forclosures taking place they are having trouble securing a loan.    Although we have nearly 100 K in equity, even at today's reduced property values. When we attempted to obtain a home equity line of credit, we were refused because our debt ratio's were too high.   Our hope is to obtain a home equity type loan through the Lending Club, which we can use to address some maintenence issues (roof) with the house and prepare it for appraisal and sale.   The value of the property will easily serve as collateral for the loan.

We are seeking some help to take the worry off our shoulders- allowing us to enjoy this moment without the stresses of money being present.  The $3000 we are seeking to borrow would be going towards the balance due to the caterer, the flowers (we are frugal and have decided to get the flowers from Costco), bridal hair and make-up, and the wedding favors for the guests.  Please know that paying this loan back would be a top priority for me.  I don't take borrowing lightly.  At this moment the time is short as the balances are due in about 10 days.

I am also a Lending Club lender and as such, will try to answer the questions I see asked most often in listings. However, if I have miss anything, ask away and I'll do my best to answer.<br/><br/>Employment<br/>==========<br/>I am a software engineer for a privately funded startup company. The company has been in existence for right at 2 years and I have been with them for 1.5. We integrate biometric solutions with banking software. Our investor is founder and chairman of one of the most widely used core banking systems in the world, which gives us a unique advantage as a startup. I will be traveling to Africa in October to install our second client. We also have 5 more signed contracts awaiting installation over the next 2 years.<br/><br/>Home Equity<br/>===========<br/>I refinanced my house earlier this year in order to convert it from a 7/1 ARM to a fixed 30-year and reduce the rate. The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.<br/><br/>Debts<br/>=====<br/>I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.<br/><br/>Budgeting<br/>=========<br/>I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:<br/><br/>$4820 : Net Monthly Income<br/>-------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 --------------<br/>$500 : Retirement<br/>$500 : Long Term Savings<br/>$500 : Short Term Savings<br/>$500 : Fun<br/>---------------------- 60 ---------------------<br/>$1250 : Mortgage<br/>$130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan)<br/>$100 : Power (average over last 3 bills)<br/>$30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$36 : Lawn<br/>$16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months)<br/>=====================================================<br/>$836<br/><br/>The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year. I intend on reducing my withholdings, which would increase my montly income beyond what is listed here.<br/><br/>Intentions<br/>==========<br/>The three year term on this loan is seen as a worst case to me. I plan, and hope, to have the loan paid off in 2 - 2.5 years.<br/>","wedding","Lender Getting Married","300xx",3.01,0,"6/1/95",3,38,NA,9,0,7114,16.5,19,FALSE,NA,6460,0

My wife and I have obtained detailed cost estimates for the project, which sum to $28,300.  At this time, we have $18,000 saved for the project, and a loan of $12,000 from the Lending Club would provide us with the difference (plus a margin of additional funds for the unexpected).  We bought our house at the end of 2005, which was just about at the peak of housing prices in our area.  We put 20% down on our house at purchase, and have a fixed rate mortgage at 6%.  Although cursory appraisals do not indicate that we are ˘ÎÎupside down˘ÎÎ_ with our mortgage, we have not had any success securing a traditional home equity loan though either our local credit union or a large national bank.  It appears that our situation is typical for these strange economic times: we have strong credit scores, a reasonable financing goal and steady income, but limited options for borrowing for remodeling.  Hence, we decided to turn to the Lending Club to finance this project.   My wife and I have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and we expect that our current house will be our ˘ÎÎforever house˘ÎÎ_.  We do not view our home as a short- or medium-term investment; it is simply where we want to live.  That stated, our kitchen is the weakest part of our house, and so we expect a relatively high return on this remodeling project.  Should something terrible happen and we are forced to sell our house, Lending Club lenders would share a proportionally small fraction of this risk, since our own funds will support well over half of the cost of the remodeling project.  My income is very reliable: I have a Ph.D. and a tenure-track position at a major research institution.  I have held this position for nearly six years.  My annual reviews have been very positive, and I have every indication that I will spend my career here.  In addition, over the last year I have had success with private consulting, which is the source for much of our savings.    I have been married for 11 years.  My wife is a painter, and is doing quite well on the local art scene.  Naturally, she has a day job, which is in the area of  non-profit administration. She has worked on and off in this area for over ten years, and she has held her current position for over four years.  It is a part-time situation that supports our finances but leaves her afternoons free to spend time in the studio before the kids get home from school.     As my credit report shows, we have consistently managed our finances responsibly.  The one blemish on my report is from a mortgage payment I missed a few years ago: I failed to update our automatic bill payment after our mortgage rate was adjusted (former mortgage, again our current mortgage is fixed).  If I recall correctly I underpaid by $26, but the lender was unsympathetic and reported it despite my pleadings.  Our current mortgage payment is approximately 20% of our gross income, and we pay on time, always.  We quit using credit cards about two years ago.  I have two modest car payments: $200 and $270.  The latter is for a car I bought my mother, who has been on disability since I was a teen and needs our help.   The estimated payment for the loan we are seeking will be in the vicinity of $375/month.  This is about what we paid in preschool tuition for my 5-year-old last year.  But he is going to kindergarten, and we will soon be relieved of this expenditure.

They were relatively small things to fix on their own, but the total cost to repair everything myself would have been significantly higher than the actual value of the car- not that the idea of doing it all anyway didn't cross my mind.

I would love a 'new-new' car, or even something slightly used, but I know that is way beyond my means.<br/><br/>Speaking of my means, I would consider myself very responsible financially.

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

In the past I had not worried so much about the card interest or making lump payoffs in order to keep my primary checking in good order.  The card companies have made the obvious mistake jacking up my interest (IMO)... I hope to pay investors of this loan a fair amount of interest instead and leave them with none.  I am currently paying around $500/month to the various cards to avoid paying a ton of interest.  About $3000 will take care of this debt.  A consequence of paying on debt is that I've only saved about $1000 in the past 8 months.  Therefore the other portion of this money will be going towards moving forward in a relationship (engagement).  I feel I am a good candidate for this loan.  I do have school and auto debt but it is very manageable.  I also hold a good paying job as an engineer in a very stable industry.

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance. Now many of the promotional APR offers have expired on those cards and the rates have gone way up.     1. Bank of America American Express - $8,272 @ 10%    2. Chase Visa - $2,550 @ 19%    3. Chase Mastercard - $6,300 @ 13%    4. Discover Card - $6,075 @ 15%    5. Citi Bank - $1,237 @ 19%    6. REI Visa - $500 @ 19%   Please let me know if you have any other questions.","debt_consolidation","Would like to pay off CC debt faster!","761xx",17.43,0,"2/1/98",0,NA,NA,17,0,29046,41.8,30,FALSE,NA,8180,0

I currently have three credit cards ($8400, 4200, and $600 balances). I would like to consolidate these debts into one payment for convenience as well as to maximize APR once promotional rate expires on these accounts.  My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!). I currently work as a paralegal and make $36,000 per year before OT, but also cater for added income, and I am very simple with my spending. I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.  My monthly budget: Salary: $2700.00 per month Mortgage/rent: $280.00 (I live with friends so rent is very cheap) Insurance: $56.00 Car expenses: $89.00 (use public transportation in Boston at $89.00 per month for train pass) Utilities: $100.00 (not part of rental agreement. Rent is one flat fee) Food, entertainment: $160.00 Clothing, household expenses $100.00 Credit cards and other loan payments: $465.00 (3 credit cards 3.99%, 12.99% and 0%) Other expenses: $39.99  Overall, I feel I am great investment, with a simple request.

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>","other","Carlos Loan","760xx",12.37,0,"4/1/07",0,NA,NA,10,0,6547,57.4,12,FALSE,NA,3329,0

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.

Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.<br><br>  I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>","credit_card","Credit card consolidation loan","201xx",17.78,0,"10/1/96",2,NA,99,15,1,17419,57.9,37,FALSE,NA,9676,0

I am interested in obtaining a loan in order to pay off all of my credit cards.  I have a stable career and have been in the same line of business since 2001.  During my college years I acquired multiple credit cards and sunk into debt.  I haven't had any late pays since early 2001.  I am the proud father of two children and husband to an amazing wife.  In 2004 my daughter broke her arm.  Due to problems with the insurance company I had at the time two collection accounts appeared on my credit file in 2005.  One for 97 dollars and another for 45.  Both have been paid off.  The first by the insurance company and the second by myself.  I have literally destroyed all of my credit cards and look forward to the day I can be free of all debt.  I thank you for helping me reach that goal and can assure you I have never defaulted on any loan.","debt_consolidation","Path to freedom from credit card debt","760xx",21.83,0,"12/1/93",2,61,NA,14,0,12025,37.2,21,FALSE,NA,4994,0

We currently hold one residential rental property there (zip=46229) through Michelle Ryan Investments, LLC (my husband's LLC, a WA and IN registered LLC).  Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.  We coordinated all aspects of the renovation of the first rental property from right here WA.  The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???  How do we make sure we meet our Lendingclub obligation???  No problem at all.  We own our existing rental house, free and clear.  Because of that, net cash flow from it is more than enough to cover our monthly Lendingclub payment, in case we have to use that source.  As many families lost their precious homes to foreclosure, they are desperately searching for a house to rent.  This has increased the demand for rental houses.  We would like to help a family get a house.  To summarize, you as a Lendingclub lender have a very low risk and have a return that's unbelievably higher than that of banks.  So, please help us help you, everyone!  Please help us help a family that needs our help.  Let's find ourselves in a win-win-win situation!  Thank you for your interest in becoming our lender.","other","PURCHASE OF RENTAL PROPERTY IN INDY","980xx",14.65,0,"1/1/95",2,NA,NA,9,0,87649,39.6,17,FALSE,NA,7136,0

In the past, hard money lenders would simply lend on investment properties based on the loan to value but now the hard money lenders want you to put up a down payment as well.  That brings me to Lending Club.  The terms through Lending Club allow me to still meet my investment parameters so I figured I would give it a try.  The loan will be used as the downpayment for an investment property that I am going to repair and resell.  The property is in the Petworth area of Washington, DC.  The purchase price is $160,000 and the repairs are estimated at $55,000 with a $5,000 contingency ($60,000 total repair estimate) for a total of $220,000 (62% of value) to acquire and fix up the property.  The after repair value of the property is $355,000 which is conversative.  My hard money lender looked at the deal and immediately said it was solid.  The hard money is lined up but the lender requires that I have some skin in the game in this environment so he wants me to put down $20,000 as a downpayment.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Axing the APR","941xx",16.8,0,"12/1/90",0,NA,NA,9,0,49692,89.3,22,FALSE,NA,8471,0

I CANCELLED THE ORIGINAL LOAN REQUEST AND RAISED MY REQUESTED AMOUNT.  I WAS AMAZED AT THE REPSONSES (THANK YOU) SO I AM GOING TO REQUEST WHAT I REALLY NEED TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON THIS DEAL. I went into business with family. I was 50% co-owner of a truckstop. We built it in 2007. For the first year and a half, my partners stood back and let me run it. I made over $300K with it in 2008. In early 2009, they decided to participate and it went down hill fast. To make a long story short, it went under in Nov. 2009. The landlord, our fuel supplier (Amaroil.com), evicted our company for past due fuel invoice debt. The landlord wishes to re-lease the site to me (because I made us money when I was alone) and understandably wants me to obtain my own working capital to re-enter the business. I cannot qualify for any conventional lending because I have no collateral. Everything I have is tied up in my business. I have one past 30 day hit on my credit record my entire life. All three of my Fico's are over 700. I am married with a 2 year old, I like to hunt and fish in my off time. I have been married for 5 years, and my wife works side by side with me in the business.<br/><br/>Your money will be paid back. Your money will go to good use (working capital).

Networks","5 years","RENT",53307,"not verified","n","https://www.lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=258644","Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.","debt_consolidation","Debt Consolidation on Back Taxes","981xx",11.37,0,"12/1/01",0,0,0,7,0,24,0.3,8,FALSE,NA,7274,0

As such, we are looking to consolidate some home improvement loans that we'd taken out and credit cards with 0% introductory rates before the introductory periods come to an end.    My financial situation:  We both currently have a good jobs and are able to comfortably make the monthly loan payments.  We am a very hard working individuals and always pay our debts.

My friend has been doing mortgages for years and he predicted this market many months ago and even prepared for it. Business is good in spite of the market and we expect it to get better shortly. With that said, the technology needs an upgrade to meet ever changing federal and state compliance laws and to prepare for addition of remote agents (trying to stay away from brick and mortar office). So the monies will be used for capital upgrades and some operating cost. I have done this with Prosper and paid back the loan months ahead of business plan projection but if not aware, Prosper is not accepting any new postings.

I am forever grateful. - Jamie<br/> Borrower added on 07/23/10 > I just saw these other little questions. <br/><br/>How do I plan to use the funds? I have credit cards and medical bills that I need to consolidate into one loan and somewhat lower interest rate in order to comfortably be able to pay and meet every loans expectations. I want to honor the debit AND to pay it off as quickly as possible. I have had folks tell me to not pay the hospital and for me frankly that is not honorable or morally right. So I am looking for solutions to pay comfortably and to pay fully.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower? I am dedicated to honesty and doing the right thing. I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget? I have about 5 credit cards and two bank loans and one large loan to the hospital. I have the obvious mortgage, auto loan and insurance, household mthly (electric, gas, water, etc). I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process. My previous job I was at for 18+ years and there to held a high position. That job was extremely stressful in location as well as duties since I worked a contract for the Department of Defense in Homeland Security. So I needed to make healthier choices and IMS heard I was looking and picked me up right away. I feel I will be at IMS forever, no doubt, well ok, until I retire. I plan on living a long life.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Jamie CC Loan","800xx",15.98,2,"10/1/87",5,7,NA,15,0,9247,58.2,44,FALSE,NA,9579,0
